It's also one of the biggest statues in the world, weighing 450,000 pounds and measuring nearly 152 feet in height.You have to take a boat or ferry to visit the Statue of Liberty up close to Liberty Island. Most people come from Battery Park, and you'll have to get in line pretty early for a smooth experience and ticket pre-purchases are highly recommended. There are also helicopter tours of New York City that will fly over the statue for a bird's-eye view of the stunning green landmark.",

It's no surprise that this green space is one of the top attractions in New York City! It's not possible to get into every single one of the individual features of Central Park. There are a few notable spots, of course. There's the seasonal pond of Conservatory Water, the romantic Bethesda Fountain topped by a sculpture of the Angel of Water, and the Loeb Boathouse. There's also the Strawberry Fields, the Wollman Memorial Rink, and the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. And don't forget the 11-foot Alice in Wonderland statue! Special events, concerts, and other festivals often occur at Central Park, so check the city's local events to see if there's anything extra going on at the park while you're there.
